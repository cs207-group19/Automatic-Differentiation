Possible software changes
-------------------------

Currently, the software can handle scalar-to-scalar functions. In the
future, we will expand the module to handle vector-to-vector functions
(and scalar-to-vector and vector-to-scalar), and also be able to trace
the Jacobian at each step. In the present state of the project, we have
not stored the derivative with respect to multiple input variables,
since there is just one input variable in the scalar-to-scalar case.
