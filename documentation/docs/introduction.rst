Introduction
============

Differentiation, i.e. finding derivatives, has long been one of the key
operations in computation related to modern science and engineering. In
optimization and numerical differential equations, finding the extrema
will require differentiation. There are many important applications of
automatic differentiation in optimization, machine learning, and
numerical methods (e.g., time integration, root-finding).

This documentation introduces ``DeriveAlive``, a software
library that uses the concept of automatic differentiation to solve
differentiation problems in scientific computing. Additional features 
of a root finding suite, an optimization suite and a quadratic spline 
suite are also listed in this documentation.
